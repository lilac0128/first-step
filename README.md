# The First Step Matters
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step

This is going to be my first step into the world of data analytics and data science. Everyone has to start somewhere, and this is where I start. Confucius says "a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step", and this is the first step I am taking. I am writing this document as I learn how to do version control with Git. I believe it will come handy in the not so distant future. 

Currently, I am an accountant. However, I am not content with being just an accountant. I believe there are so much potential for accounts in an era of big data. I want to be able to command the tools and technologies to tell stories to my clients that would provide them with critical solutions to their business problems.

Currently I am teaching myself to perform analysis using SQL, Python, and R.
